# Since dracut 24, arrays are not auto-assembled. We need to auto-assemble
# only arrays that might contain the root filesystem. Arrays that contain
# the root filesystem should have the GUID that corresponds to root on raid

# We only want to only assemble the array with the root partition since a user could
# specify different behavior for assembling other arrays (e.g. in mdadm.conf) and
# mdadm can't find that until we switch_root.

# These rules complement the rules in 65-md-raid-assemble-root, only adding the
# incremental assembly. 65-md-raid-assemble-root has rules for ACTION=remove. See
# the dracut 90mdraid module's module-setup.sh for the sed line that removes the
# add|change line we are adding back here.

# In the future we may want to add support for things like lvm which should get their
# own partition type GUID which should be handled here.
